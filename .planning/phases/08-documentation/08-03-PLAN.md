<objective>
Create LICENSE, SECURITY.md, and CHANGELOG.md for legal and operational documentation.

Purpose: Establish legal terms (AGPL-3.0), security reporting process, and version tracking for open source release.

Output: LICENSE file with AGPL-3.0 text, SECURITY.md with vulnerability reporting, CHANGELOG.md with Keep a Changelog format.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create LICENSE file with AGPL-3.0</name>
  <files>LICENSE</files>
  <action>
Create LICENSE file at project root with the full GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 text.

The file should start with:

```
                    GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 19 November 2007

 Copyright (C) 2024-2026 LivOS Contributors

 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
```

Then include the complete AGPL-3.0 license text from:
https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.txt

This is the standard AGPL-3.0 text - do not modify except for the copyright holder line.

Why AGPL-3.0:
- Requires derivative works to be open source
- Network use counts as distribution (important for server software)
- Protects against closed-source SaaS forks

Verify LICENSE:
1. File exists at project root (no extension)
2. Contains "GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE"
3. Contains "Version 3"
4. File is 660+ lines (full license text)
  </verify>
  <done>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Create SECURITY.md</name>
  <files>SECURITY.md</files>
  <action>
Create SECURITY.md at project root with the following sections:

1. **Security Policy header**

2. **Supported Versions**
   Table showing which versions receive security updates:
   | Version | Supported          |
   | ------- | ------------------ |
   | 1.x.x   | :white_check_mark: |
   | < 1.0   | :x:                |

3. **Reporting a Vulnerability**
   - DO NOT open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities
   - Email: security@livinity.io
   - Include:
     - Description of the vulnerability
     - Steps to reproduce
     - Potential impact
     - Any suggested fixes (optional)

4. **Response Timeline**
   - Acknowledgment: within 48 hours
   - Initial assessment: within 7 days
   - Fix timeline: depends on severity
     - Critical: 24-48 hours
     - High: 7 days
     - Medium: 30 days
     - Low: 90 days

5. **Disclosure Policy**
   - We follow coordinated disclosure
   - Researcher credited in security advisory (unless anonymity requested)
   - 90-day disclosure deadline

6. **Security-Sensitive Areas**
   List areas that require extra scrutiny:
   - API authentication (LIV_API_KEY validation)
   - Shell command execution (command blocklist)
   - File system access
   - Docker socket access
   - JWT token handling

7. **Safe Harbor**
   - Good-faith security researchers will not face legal action
   - Avoid:
     - Accessing other users' data
     - Denial of service attacks
     - Physical security attacks
     - Social engineering

8. **PGP Key** (optional - placeholder)
   - Note: PGP key for encrypted reports coming soon
