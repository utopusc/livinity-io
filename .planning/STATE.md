# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-24)

**Core value:** One-command deployment of a personal AI-powered server, accessible anywhere via livinity.io.
**Current milestone:** v27.0 — Docker Management Upgrade
**Current focus:** Phase 17 complete; Phase 18 (Container File Browser) next

## Current Position

Phase: 17 — Docker Quick Wins (COMPLETE)
Plan: 02 complete — Redeploy-with-pull button + extended AI docker_manage tool
Status: 17-01 + 17-02 complete; QW-01/02/03/04 all satisfied. Phase 17 fully closed.
Last activity: 2026-04-24 — Plan 17-02 executed in 8 minutes, 4 tasks committed atomically

**Progress:** [██████████] 100%

## Accumulated Context

### v27.0 Roadmap Decisions

- Phase 17 is foundation (real-time logs, secret env, redeploy button, AI tool expansion) — unblocks UI polish downstream
- Phases 18/19/20/22 parallelizable (only depend on Phase 17)
- Phase 21 (GitOps) depends on Phase 20's scheduler for auto-sync
- Phase 23 (AI diagnostics) depends on Phase 19's vulnerability scanning for AID-04
- Dockhand-inspired features: file browser, graph viewer, vuln scan, GitOps stacks, multi-host — all catching up to competitor parity
- AI-powered diagnostics (Phase 23) = Livinity's unique moat, no competing Docker manager has this

### Plan 17-01 Decisions (2026-04-24)

- Reused `stripDockerStreamHeaders` by exporting it unchanged from `docker.ts` (single source of truth for Docker frame parsing)
- `editStack` uses incremental delete-missing + set-non-empty (NOT `deleteAll`) — allows UI to submit blank-value secret rows to preserve stored values on edit
- `controlStack('up')` also injects secret envOverrides (otherwise stop→up cycles would lose secret env)
- `removeStack` purges Redis secret hash best-effort (`.catch(() => {})`) — a Redis outage cannot block stack teardown
- LogsTab search input is visible v1 placeholder; xterm search addon deferred to v28 per plan guidance
- `JWT_SECRET_PATH` hardcoded to `/opt/livos/data/secrets/jwt` — lift to env var only if dev environment needs a different location
- Pattern establishment: WebSocket streaming handler factory is the reference for Phase 18 (file browser) and Phase 20 (scheduler tail); AES-256-GCM-with-JWT-key is the reference for Phase 21 GIT-01 (git credential encryption)

### Plan 17-02 Decisions (2026-04-24)

- AI `docker_manage` stays on local Docker socket + host `docker compose` CLI (via `child_process.exec`) — NOT livinityd tRPC. Matches existing start/stop/restart/inspect/logs ops; no JWT plumbing needed. Compose files under `/opt/livos/data/stacks/<name>/` are shared with livinityd so AI-created stacks appear in the UI immediately.
- `PROTECTED_STACK_PREFIXES = ['livos', 'nexus-infrastructure', 'caddy']` guards `DockerManager.removeStack` — mirrors livinityd's container-level protection at stack level since `isProtectedContainer` isn't cross-process reachable.
- `controlStack('pull-and-up')` re-injects secret env overrides (same path as `'up'`) — upgrading a secret-bearing stack via the Redeploy button keeps its encrypted env vars intact.
- Renamed inner `exec` local to `execInstance` in `DockerManager.exec()` to avoid shadowing the module-scoped `promisify(cpExec)` — zero behavioral change, required by TypeScript.
- Redeploy ActionButton reuses `color='blue'` (no new `'violet'` variant) per plan explicit guidance; distinguishes via title "Redeploy (pull latest images)".
- AI `stack-deploy` does NOT expose `secret: true` flag on envVars — the secret store is a livinityd-owned concern. Deferred to v28: either route AI stack-deploy through livinityd tRPC with an internal JWT, or grant nexus DockerManager read access to the same Redis key.

### Carried from v26.0

- Deployment warning: REDIS_URL must be set on platform/web for SESS-03 instant teardown
- Stale comment at server/index.ts:984 refers to old recordAuthFailure name
- v25.0 tech debt: wa_outbox dead code, chunkForWhatsApp unused, Integrations menu label, linkIdentity() never called

### Pending Todos

None

### Blockers/Concerns

- Mini PC SSH direct IP (10.69.31.68) currently unreachable — deploys to bruce will need tunnel-based access or network reconnection
- Phase 22 (multi-host agent) is the largest in scope (3 plans); may split further during plan-phase
