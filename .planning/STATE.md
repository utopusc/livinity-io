## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

v1.5 decisions (carried forward):
- [Milestone]: Claude Code SDK subscription mode (dontAsk permissionMode)
- [Milestone]: SdkAgentRunner as primary agent execution engine
- [Milestone]: Nexus tools via MCP (nexus-tools server)
- [Tech]: Telegram dedup via Redis NX + stale message filter

v2.0 decisions:
- [Milestone]: Claude Code Auth ONLY — no API keys, no Gemini, no OpenAI
- [Milestone]: Telegram + Discord only (WhatsApp deferred)
- [Milestone]: Cartesia for TTS, Deepgram for STT
- [Milestone]: Web-based Live Canvas via iframe srcdoc (no A2UI, no Sandpack)
- [Milestone]: LivHub branding for skill registry
- [Milestone]: Session compaction via SessionManager (not native Compaction API — incompatible with subscription mode)
- [Milestone]: DAG topology for multi-agent (no recursive sub-agents)
- [Milestone]: Gmail polling default, Pub/Sub as advanced option

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

- nexus-core: 153 PM2 restarts in 47h — root cause analysis needed in Phase 1
- Memory service empty results — needs debugging
- SdkAgentRunner tools:[] doesn't disable built-in Bash/Read/Write (SDK issue #115)
- SDK token visibility in subscription mode — MEDIUM confidence, verify before Phase 3 usage schema
